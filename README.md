# Charged Up 2023

Can't build/deploy your code due to a "Spotless" error? Here's how to fix it.
Run `./gradlew spotlessApply` to fix the formatting of your code., or for 
windows `gradlew.bat spotlessApply` in the root directory of the project.

Spotless ensures that our code maintains a constant style, which makes the code
easier to read and maintain.
